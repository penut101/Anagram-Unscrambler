**Anagram Unscrambler:**

This project implements an efficient solution for unscrambling multi-word anagrams using recursive backtracking techniques.

**Features**
 - Dictionary Management System: Utilizes dictionary.txt and a multiway trie to optimize runtime performance and enhance solving efficiency.

 - Prefix-Based Word Search: A method integrated within the trie to improve the backtracking process and significantly increase the solution speed.
